# Snake Motion
With [SnakeMotion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeoEmberArt/Aslyis/main/Addons/SnakeMotion.py), you can easily and quickly make a snake slither with a few clicks and animating just **1** object. (it cant get easier than this)

## How to use
* ***Select an armature*** and go into pose mode
* ***Select the bones*** you want to use (perferably all)
	* Bones that arent selected will be avalable for manual animating
	* Make sure the root bone (bone that will move the entire armature) is selected or the armature will not move
* Click **Setup**
* The empty that is selected will be the Controller/driver. A keyframe is allready added
* ***Animate the empty***
* Click **Bake**
* Watch your masterpeice slither

> **ProTip:** Selecting all bones in an armature can help reduce the chance of an error, Bones must also stay as a single line; If it splits: you may blow up the snake
