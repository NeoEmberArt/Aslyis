## How to use
* ***Select an armature*** and go into pose mode
* ***Select the bones*** you want to use (perferably all)
	* Bones that arent selected will be avalable for manual animating
	* Make sure the root bone (bone that will move the entire armature) is selected or the armature will not move
* Click **Setup**
* The empty that is selected will be the Controller/driver. A keyframe is allready added
